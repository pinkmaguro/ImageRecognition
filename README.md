#My toy project - Building a machine learning system for recognizing handwriting numbers.

This project is for fun and education purposes while building a minimum but complete machine learning system.

#Algorithms and some ideas for this project
- One vs All logistic regression  (not neural network or others)
- typical slow batch gradient descent

#Future update? Yes
- use faster gradient descent for calcuating global minimum of cost function.
- visualize how theta matrix changes with more training set.
